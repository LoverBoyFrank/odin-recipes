    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ratatouille is a classic French vegetable dish that celebrates fresh, 
        simple ingredients. Tender slices of zucchini, eggplant, and squash 
        are layered or gently simmered with tomatoes, onion, and garlic, creating 
        a dish that is both colorful and comforting with rich, natural flavors.</p>
        <p>Slow-cooked until the vegetables are soft and fragrant, ratatouille is finished 
            with olive oil and herbs that bring everything together. Light yet satisfying, 
            it can be served on its own, over rice or pasta, or as a flavorful side dish.
