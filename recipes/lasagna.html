    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="Lasagna.jpg" height="400" width="600">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna starts with a rich, slow simmered meat sauce that
        fills the kitchen with warmth and aroma. Ground beef is browned with 
        onion and garlic, then gently cooked in a tomato sauce seasoned with 
        oregano, basil, and a touch of black pepper. As the sauce thickens,
        the falvors deepen, creating a hearty base that balances savory meat 
        with bright tomato notes. Meanwhile, lasagna noodles are cooked until 
        just tender, ready to soak up the layers of falvor to come.
    </p>
    <p>To assemble, a thin layer of sauce is spread in the baking dish, 
        followed by noodles, creamy ricotta cheese mixed with an egg and parsley, 
        and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella. The layers are repeated until the 
        dish is full, finishing with sauce and a blanket of melted mozzarella 
        and grated Parmesan. Baked until bubbling and golden, this lasagna 
        emerges from the oven perfectly layered—tender pasta, creamy cheese, a
        nd robust sauce in every bite—best enjoyed after a short rest to let 
        the layers set.
