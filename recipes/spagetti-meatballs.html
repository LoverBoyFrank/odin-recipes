    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Spaghetti and meatballs is a comforting classic built around a rich, 
        savory tomato sauce and tender pasta. Juicy meatballs made from 
        ground meat, breadcrumbs, and simple seasonings are browned until golden, 
        then gently simmered in the sauce so they absorb its deep, robust flavor. 
        The spaghetti is cooked until perfectly al dente, creating a satisfying 
        base that pairs beautifully with the hearty sauce.</p>
        <p>To serve, the spaghetti is tossed or topped with the meatballs 
            and ladled with plenty of sauce. A finishing sprinkle of grated 
            Parmesan cheese and fresh herbs adds brightness and balance. Warm, 
            filling, and familiar, this dish is perfect for a cozy family dinner 
            or a simple homemade meal any night of the week.</p>
